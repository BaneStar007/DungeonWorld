   <h2>Cataclyzm</h2>

   <h4>What is it?</h4>

   <b>What is you game, in 1 sentence.</b>

   <p>Cataclyzm is a Roleplay Game and System, Set in a bleak, deadly world, players have to survive, then thrive, then
      conquer the world.</p>

   <b>2. What is you game in 1 paragraph.</b>

   <p>Using the simplified Dungeonworld Rules, called DungeonDelversTwelve, Cataclyzm focusses on a limited set of
      rules,
      Combat, Crafting and Mysticism, to create a unique roleplay experience.</p>
   <p>Players first discover how to fight to survive, then they craft goods to help themselves not just defend
      themselves,
      but next to be on the attack.</p>
   <p>Once they have figured out the basics, they can progress onward to build a community of PPCs, or Previously Played
      Characters. Retired heroes who look after the community.</p>

   <b>3. Can I see your game</b>

   <b>4. What do I need to do to get involved (pledges)</b>

   <p>The Kickstarter is coming, for now, sign up, down load the PDF, play test with your friends, give feedback, and
      prepare for the Cataclyzm</p>

   <b>5. What happens next?</b>

   <p>Over the next few months, I'm working on the rules to be publishable. What you have here is the latest version. I
      update this PDF every few weeks, so if you haven't downloaded a copy in the last month, do it now.</p>
   <p>The Kickstarter is for the physical book, and Art to go inside. The Basic Minimum Book will have the Rules, a hard
      card cover, some art, some sketches and some printable PDFs for a board/standees.</p>
   <p>If the KS funds, and we hit certain goals, More art will be added, more parts will be created, the board and
      standees
      updated, and plausibly miniatures can be created.</p>

      <li>Step Two, Correlate the Document.</li>
      <li>Step Three, Send it out to all backers.</li>
   </ul>

   <b>7. Do you have any videos, or downloads of your product so i can test/watch it myself?</b>
   <p>In Progress</p>

   <b>8. Why Should I trust you?</b>
   <p>I try to be truthful and upfront about all my internet dealings, if you encounter me on reddit, facebook or
      such, you
      should see that, while I am a complex person who thinks a little too deeeply about things, I also attempt to be
      decent, regardless of what people might say or do.</p>

   <b>FAQ: why is it spelt like that?</b>
   <p>I agree, its annoying, I have a background as an English teacher and it annoys me to no end.</p>
   <p>In a world of the Internet, there are hundreds of designers, developers and products. Your name is your address
      on
      the internet. If I used the correct spelling of Cataclysm, people searching for me get 100 webpages, if I use a
      different spelling I get 1 page, mine, and anyone who tries to use it, I can block, because as the
      'non-correct'
      spelling, I can trademark the name for me alone.</p>
