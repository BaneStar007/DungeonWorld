      Using the simplified Dungeonworld Rules, called DungeonDelversTwelve, Cataclyzm focusses on a limited set of rules, Combat, Crafting and Mysticism, to create a unique roleplay experience.

      4. What do I need to do to get involved (pledges) 

The Kickstarter is coming, for now, sign up, down load the PDF, play test with your friends, give feedback, and prepare for the Cataclyzm

      5. What happens next? 

Over the next few months, I'm working on the rules to be publishable. What you have here is the latest version. I update this PDF every few weeks, so if you haven't downloaded a copy in the last month, do it now.
The Kickstarter is for the physical book, and Art to go inside. The Basic Minimum Book will have the Rules, a hard card cover, some art, some sketches and some printable PDFs for a board/standees.
If the KS funds, and we hit certain goals, More art will be added, more parts will be created, the board and standees updated, and plausibly miniatures can be created.

      6. What happens if you fund, whats the step by step plan you have. 

Step One, Artists, Based on total.      
      7. Do you have any videos, or downloads of your product so i can test/watch it myself? 
      8. Why Should I trust you?

      FAQ: why is it spell like that?
      I agree, its annoying, I have a background as an English teacher and it annoys me to no end.
      In a world of the Internet, there are hundreds of designers, developers and products. Your name is your address on the internet. If I used the correct spelling of Cataclysm, people searching for me get 100 webpages, if I use a different spelling I get 1 page, mine, and anyone who tries to use it, I can block, because as the 'non-correct' spelling, I can trademark the name for me alone.
