The reach of evil spread beyond the fortress walls, spreading to the forests like a plague, inviting the foulest of creatures to surface.

Something still dwells there, though what evil it is remains a mystery. It’s rumored that a massive treasure still sits deep within Vonnarath’s belly, guarded by a fearsome creature beyond all evils.

Once the monument had been fully erected, Gilborn waited. Days, weeks, months went by, but nothing. Nothing, except from a few roses growing at the base of the statue.
