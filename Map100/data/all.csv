This warmth combined with the snowy landscape produces eerie tendrils of steam rising from the entrance giving the cavern an otherworldly and most forbidding appearance.

The Silver Spring is a miracle of nature with water spilling up from a crack in bedrock keeping a shallow pool seemingly consistently filled. The water glitters in the sunlight due to the high mica content in the bedrock. The individuals hired to keep the water supply safe are called the Waterwatch. They are directed by the Spring Keeper (mayor), a highly logical, fair, but unsympathetic leader. The only other strangers in this constantly struggling town, other than the traders who use Driden as a waypoint, are the treasure hunters. These brave souls use Driden as their home base for venturing deeper in the desert to find the lost tombs and hidden treasure rumored to be hidden beneath the shifting sands.

Some say they broke up in angst, some say they found wealth beyond imagination. What Mylar studies is unknown, he seems benign to some and to others he is whispered to do many foul things. His companion Sam is said to be a little goblin or a large blue monster (think Ogre Magi) or a multitude of other creatures. As with anything unknown the stories that are passed around are legion and just as varied. Some say the tower is the an entrance to a hidden warren of dwarves ruins filled with gold and other riches from the ground. Others say there is a hidden dungeon where an evil cult once flourished until Mylar deafened them with his powerful magics. in near by towns and villages, Mylar is seen as a tall, skeletal man who shows up to purchase supplies from time to time, He never uses his name and plays off that he is a herder of sheep in the mountains. Mylar loves to read and travels to larger cities to seek out and purchase tomes of all sorts. Thus there is also rumored to be a large library in his abode. Mylar is a very high level wizard that truly just wants to be alone. He is overly tall at seven and one half feet and so thin to look skeletal. He will try to dissuade anyone that shows up at his doorstep up to defending his home with deadly force. His companion is also fiercely loyal and will use all his abilities as an Ogre Magi to defend Mylar. The tower and abandoned mine under the tower are laced with magical and non magical traps in case someone does make it into the tower. Mylar will be relentless in his defense and if defeated will not rest until he has recovered his home and possessions . The tower is in good repair , while the vegetation surrounding it is over grown more to lack of interest than anything.

Mae-Mae chose a defensible location as she sensed the pending onslaught from the dark denizens of the forest. When the attack came in the dead of night, Mae-Mae was already awake and alert. The druid led her followers to battle, moving from skirmish to skirmish, wherever the fighting was most fierce and the situation most dire. Though she would surrender her life in the attempt, the battle would be won. Her final wish was for her town to remain, to defend the forest against further attack and to train those in the future. The town has slowly expanded since then. The area immediately surrounding is is kept safe, and the town welcomes those willing to listen to nature's lessons. Rangers and druids accept students, while herbalists can learn new tricks of healing.
