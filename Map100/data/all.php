Great statues once guarded its gates, steps of carved stone leading to a large fortress capped with menacing spires like speartips prodding the sky. Now its all cracked and crumbling, statues misshapen by neglect (or residual dark magic), some having their faces mysteriously broken away into fragmented skulls. The fortress hugs the mountainside, which is cragged and steep. A snowmelt stream tumbles down from the peak above, cutting through the fortress on one side before exiting in a waterfall at the edge of the fortress side (the stairs from the gate are beside the falls, making the stones treacherously slick and the drop from them steep). Few evergreen trees occupy this altitude, and the ones near the fortress are dead and haunting, looking as if they could snare passers-by with their barren limbs. It&#039;s a perfect home for death, and it willingly grants it to any unscrupulous visitor.",

    "8. Describe Your Terrain, Border Terrain And Biome.": "The terrain is mountainous, part of a massive range of jagged peaks like teeth of some leviathan&#039;s maw. Snow constantly caps many of the peaks, creating many small rivers and waterfalls throughout, all flowing down into a larger body nearby (lake, ocean, sea, depending on nearby location). Lush forests, deep and thick, grow at its base. Trails cut through the forest disappear quickly, the woods quick to reclaim what&#039;s theirs once again, making it very easy for the average traveler to get lost. The fortress was built for the gold and jewels harvested from mountain stone, though the rock here is very tough and unforgiving. In addition to the rough stone and thick forest growth, the lower terrain also host numerous formidable creatures, from large spiders to ferocious greystone panthers and everything inbetween.",
    "StyleType": "Abandoned/Ruins",
    "Style Description": "The fortress was constructed of harshly cut stone, dwarven inspired carvings, but constructed by men. Statues are usually imposing, like armored knights with shield and sword, or fearsome creatures. The front gate to the steps is guarded by twin knights with massive shields, intricately detailed and at the ready, as if they could spring to life and battle at any moment. The steps rise up beside the waterfall, with occasional outcroppings for statues or guardposts where the terrain allowed. The black magic conducted at the castle appears to have had an affect over all of it, turning even the stone darker. The once sturdy construction now crumbles, falling away sometimes with the faintest touch while other cracks hold firm. Skeletons of the dead can be found throughout the territory, grim reminders of how lethal the area can be.",

    "PDF_Description": "Vonnarath&#039;s Keep, now known more as Vonnarath&#039;s Crypt, was once a formidable fortress, built from heavy stone mined from the mountain. Its wealth grew rapidly, fed with gold and jewels pulled from deep in the mountain. But greed corrupts, and the heart of Vonnarath grew darker with every jewel extracted from the stone. It is believe some of those very treasures harbored an evil in their faceted glimmers, and before long the master of Vonnarath himself delved into the dark magical arts. The reach of evil spread beyond the fortress walls, spreading to the forests like a plague, inviting the foulest of creatures to surface. Vonnarath fell to its own evils, the darkness consuming every soul until no man remained alive. Now it sits in deathly silence, its fires extinguished, its halls dark. But it is not abandoned. Something still dwells there, though what evil it is remains a mystery. It’s rumored that a massive treasure still sits deep within Vonnarath’s belly, guarded by a fearsome creature beyond all evils. Some say it’s a great black dragon, a serpent of fire and ash. Others tell of a massive spider, larger than a house, fangs glistening with hunger beneath eight eyes of pure blackness. Still others say it’s a demon pulled from the seven hells through the dark magic, a hulking creature of living stone veined with magma and a lust for destruction. No one knows for sure, for no soul has visited Vonnarath and lived to tell.",

A stark contrast to the peaceful and tranquil lake waters he stands near.

Scarce accounts describe luminescent, ochre crystals known as Emberen, which line the walls of the grotto. The promise of wealth has tempted many to travel in search of this antre, yet those few that do return do so raving of flames...and cannibals. At your discretion as to if and how to include the following: DM: The crystals emit a mild warmth that while almost imperceptable when encountered in small quantities can be susbtantial in large concentrations. This warmth combined with the snowy landscape produces eerie tendrils of steam rising from the entrance giving the cavern an otherworldly and most forbidding appearance. The crystals contained within are quite valuable, but the formidable terrain, oppresive heat, and local nomadic tribe that worship the cave make it almost impossible to retrieve even small amounts of the crystals.",

Something, happened on one such adventure, that made Rose dissappear. Gilborn would not talk about it, never discussing what happened to her. Gilborn traveled to the largest and closest rock formation he could, and began to carve his trusty companion into the cliffside. He wanted it to be seen from afar so she would run back to him, as in her satchel were many valuable maps and treasures. Dwarves from all over the many plains came to Gilborns aid to construct this gigantic monument. Years, years and years, it took to construct this monument. But alas, she never came. From all around the surrounding areas this gigantic dog could be seen. Gilborn had set up camp, and over the time of construction, he inspired others to do the same, forming a small community. Some traders set up a small town to capitalise on the artistry at hand, to share tales and rumours to new travelers, to seek out Rose&#039;s treasure. Once the monument had been fully erected, Gilborn waited. Days, weeks, months went by, but nothing. Nothing, except from a few roses growing at the base of the statue. Later, as time went on, other wild and undomesticted animals gathered to the statue, something magical drawing them maybe. Adventurers that gathered would tame these animals and have a companion of their own, and some even setting out to find Rose and collect Gilborn treasure.",

The Silver Spring is a miracle of nature with water spilling up from a crack in bedrock keeping a shallow pool seemingly consistently filled. The water glitters in the sunlight due to the high mica content in the bedrock. The individuals hired to keep the water supply safe are called the Waterwatch. They are directed by the Spring Keeper (mayor), a highly logical, fair, but unsympathetic leader. The only other strangers in this constantly struggling town, other than the traders who use Driden as a waypoint, are the treasure hunters. These brave souls use Driden as their home base for venturing deeper in the desert to find the lost tombs and hidden treasure rumored to be hidden beneath the shifting sands. Many chase after these rumors of riches, but few return from the deep of the desert.",

    "Style Other": "",
    "PDF_Description": "The tower is the home for Mylar the Hermit Mage. Mylar prefers to live alone with his companion \"Sam\". Mylar was a famous adventurer at one time. He retired when his company of explorers defeated an ancient red dragon. Some say they broke up in angst, some say they found wealth beyond imagination. What Mylar studies is unknown, he seems benign to some and to others he is whispered to do many foul things. His companion Sam is said to be a little goblin or a large blue monster (think Ogre Magi) or a multitude of other creatures. As with anything unknown the stories that are passed around are legion and just as varied. Some say the tower is the an entrance to a hidden warren of dwarves ruins filled with gold and other riches from the ground. Others say there is a hidden dungeon where an evil cult once flourished until Mylar deafened them with his powerful magics. in near by towns and villages, Mylar is seen as a tall, skeletal man who shows up to purchase supplies from time to time, He never uses his name and plays off that he is a herder of sheep in the mountains. Mylar loves to read and travels to larger cities to seek out and purchase tomes of all sorts. Thus there is also rumored to be a large library in his abode. Mylar is a very high level wizard that truly just wants to be alone. He is overly tall at seven and one half feet and so thin to look skeletal. He will try to dissuade anyone that shows up at his doorstep up to defending his home with deadly force. His companion is also fiercely loyal and will use all his abilities as an Ogre Magi to defend Mylar. The tower and abandoned mine under the tower are laced with magical and non magical traps in case someone does make it into the tower. Mylar will be relentless in his defense and if defeated will not rest until he has recovered his home and possessions . The tower is in good repair , while the vegetation surrounding it is over grown more to lack of interest than anything. Mylar prefers the fresh crisp air from his tower top to the shadows of the ground. I hope this all is coherent and please edit as you see fit.",

Others from the village were happy to join his caravan, they too had heard enough howling and screaming in the night, others were either too foolish or too cowardly to brave the surrounding woods, they couldn&#039;t wield a weapon as Gunthor did. Though the marshes weren&#039;t the most ideal location for a new settlement it was far enough from the village and the lands were rich with iron ore, Gunthor would be able to craft new weapons and erect some simple defenses. Days quickly became months and more permenant shelters were being built, others had stopped by to offer trade or sometimes join their colony.

No one knows when the great tower at the center of the Seven-Four-Seven was built, or who built it. Some say the gleaming white, honeycomb structure merely appeared one day, or is the last remains of some ancient God. But legends tell that any who manages to scale the unnaturally smooth tower will live out the rest of their days blessed with peace and prosperity. Few have succeeded. Most fall to their doom below, where their bodies are left to rot and feed the earth beneath the tower. To those who live in the Seven-Four-Seven, this is an honorable death. These bones remain undisturbed, bleached white like the tower over centuries. The Seven-Four-Seven can be a terrible sight to behold for newcomers, but the townsfolk are among the most welcoming and agreeable in the region. So long as visitors don&#039;t disturb the bones.",

Mae-Mae chose a defensible location as she sensed the pending onslaught from the dark denizens of the forest. When the attack came in the dead of night, Mae-Mae was already awake and alert. The druid led her followers to battle, moving from skirmish to skirmish, wherever the fighting was most fierce and the situation most dire. Though she would surrender her life in the attempt, the battle would be won. Her final wish was for her town to remain, to defend the forest against further attack and to train those in the future. The town has slowly expanded since then. The area immediately surrounding is is kept safe, and the town welcomes those willing to listen to nature&#039;s lessons. Rangers and druids accept students, while herbalists can learn new tricks of healing. The druid&#039;s grove of the town is renowned despite the towns small size.",
