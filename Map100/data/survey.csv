   "Any Thoughts to add?": "Sea travel seems so compelling, yet is never a focus of any campaign I’ve played (including piratical campaigns!)  Valleys are great because they can include or be near any terrain type  (badlands to meadows to mountains to forests or jungles) or water feature (wide lazy rivers to steep rushing rapids to deep mysterious lakes.)  Valleys are finite; they are constrained.   Because of the apparent constraint against wide ranging travel, a valley campaign encourages players to really become intimately involved and deeply invested in the special place where they are from:  to know it like the back of their hand.  They’ll leave eventually, but that map is for another Kickstarter!"
