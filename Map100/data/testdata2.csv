Though most that perish in the nearby city end up here, the majority of the graves in Spindrift Peak lie empty, memorials to sailors lost at sea. The cemetery is only surrounded on three sides by the high ornate walls that are Spindrift’s hallmark. The seaward side is walled off only by the towering Cliffside kept open, legend says, so that the spouses of sailors could stand and watch for their seafaring partners to return to them.",

Great statues once guarded its gates, steps of carved stone leading to a large fortress capped with menacing spires like speartips prodding the sky. Now its all cracked and crumbling, statues misshapen by neglect (or residual dark magic), some having their faces mysteriously broken away into fragmented skulls. The fortress hugs the mountainside, which is cragged and steep. A snowmelt stream tumbles down from the peak above, cutting through the fortress on one side before exiting in a waterfall at the edge of the fortress side (the stairs from the gate are beside the falls, making the stones treacherously slick and the drop from them steep). Few evergreen trees occupy this altitude, and the ones near the fortress are dead and haunting, looking as if they could snare passers-by with their barren limbs. It's a perfect home for death, and it willingly grants it to any unscrupulous visitor.",

    "8. Describe Your Terrain Border Terrain And Biome.": "The terrain is mountainous, part of a massive range of jagged peaks like teeth of some leviathan's maw. Snow constantly caps many of the peaks, creating many small rivers and waterfalls throughout, all flowing down into a larger body nearby (lake, ocean, sea, depending on nearby location). Lush forests, deep and thick, grow at its base. Trails cut through the forest disappear quickly, the woods quick to reclaim what's theirs once again, making it very easy for the average traveler to get lost. The fortress was built for the gold and jewels harvested from mountain stone, though the rock here is very tough and unforgiving. In addition to the rough stone and thick forest growth, the lower terrain also host numerous formidable creatures, from large spiders to ferocious greystone panthers and everything inbetween.",
    "9b. Using The Key Ideas Of The Styles Given You Can Add Some Flourish?": "The fortress was constructed of harshly cut stone, dwarven inspired carvings, but constructed by men. Statues are usually imposing, like armored knights with shield and sword, or fearsome creatures. The front gate to the steps is guarded by twin knights with massive shields, intricately detailed and at the ready, as if they could spring to life and battle at any moment. The steps rise up beside the waterfall, with occasional outcroppings for statues or guardposts where the terrain allowed. The black magic conducted at the castle appears to have had an affect over all of it, turning even the stone darker. The once sturdy construction now crumbles, falling away sometimes with the faintest touch while other cracks hold firm. Skeletons of the dead can be found throughout the territory, grim reminders of how lethal the area can be.",
    "10. What Text Do You Want To Appear In The Document For This Location?": "Vonnarath's Keep, now known more as Vonnarath's Crypt, was once a formidable fortress, built from heavy stone mined from the mountain. Its wealth grew rapidly, fed with gold and jewels pulled from deep in the mountain. But greed corrupts, and the heart of Vonnarath grew darker with every jewel extracted from the stone. It is believe some of those very treasures harbored an evil in their faceted glimmers, and before long the master of Vonnarath himself delved into the dark magical arts. The reach of evil spread beyond the fortress walls, spreading to the forests like a plague, inviting the foulest of creatures to surface. Vonnarath fell to its own evils, the darkness consuming every soul until no man remained alive. Now it sits in deathly silence, its fires extinguished, its halls dark. But it is not abandoned. Something still dwells there, though what evil it is remains a mystery. It’s rumored that a massive treasure still sits deep within Vonnarath’s belly, guarded by a fearsome creature beyond all evils. Some say it’s a great black dragon, a serpent of fire and ash. Others tell of a massive spider, larger than a house, fangs glistening with hunger beneath eight eyes of pure blackness. Still others say it’s a demon pulled from the seven hells through the dark magic, a hulking creature of living stone veined with magma and a lust for destruction. No one knows for sure, for no soul has visited Vonnarath and lived to tell.",

Once a welcoming, though imposing, figure to the territory, it now stands as a grim warning. It is cracked and crumbling, like the fortress itself, and no longer bids welcome, instead looking like a guardian of death's palace, a grim spectre with a chipped and ragged sword, as if he'd strode out from the depths of some tortured hell. A stark contrast to the peaceful and tranquil lake waters he stands near. Even the forest here seems greener, as if the evils had not yet reached out from the deep forest to its edges, the knight a warning of what's beyond.",

The promise of wealth has tempted many to travel in search of this antre, yet those few that do return do so raving of flames...and cannibals. At your discretion as to if and how to include the following: DM: The crystals emit a mild warmth that while almost imperceptable when encountered in small quantities can be susbtantial in large concentrations. This warmth combined with the snowy landscape produces eerie tendrils of steam rising from the entrance giving the cavern an otherworldly and most forbidding appearance. The crystals contained within are quite valuable, but the formidable terrain, oppresive heat, and local nomadic tribe that worship the cave make it almost impossible to retrieve even small amounts of the crystals.",

Something, happened on one such adventure, that made Rose dissappear. Gilborn would not talk about it, never discussing what happened to her. Gilborn traveled to the largest and closest rock formation he could, and began to carve his trusty companion into the cliffside. He wanted it to be seen from afar so she would run back to him, as in her satchel were many valuable maps and treasures. Dwarves from all over the many plains came to Gilborns aid to construct this gigantic monument. Years, years and years, it took to construct this monument. But alas, she never came. From all around the surrounding areas this gigantic dog could be seen. Gilborn had set up camp, and over the time of construction, he inspired others to do the same, forming a small community. Some traders set up a small town to capitalise on the artistry at hand, to share tales and rumours to new travelers, to seek out Rose's treasure. Once the monument had been fully erected, Gilborn waited. Days, weeks, months went by, but nothing. Nothing, except from a few roses growing at the base of the statue. Later, as time went on, other wild and undomesticted animals gathered to the statue, something magical drawing them maybe. Adventurers that gathered would tame these animals and have a companion of their own, and some even setting out to find Rose and collect Gilborn treasure.",
