Only one thing remains clear: the guardian seems to stare resolutely across the clearing to the hole in the earth, seemingly prepared for whatever may come forth. Listening at the dark void will reveal nothing of what lives below, but a foul stench will threaten to overwhelm even the hardiest of adventurers. The grove gets its name from the rumors that on a cold night a true hero can hear the statue whisper advice or perhaps foretell the end of the world, but other say this is simply wind rushing from the dungeon like a dead man's last breath. The locals speak of this place in hushed tones, though the reason to do so has also been forgotten.",

Mylar prefers to live alone with his companion \"Sam\". Mylar was a famous adventurer at one time. He retired when his company of explorers defeated an ancient red dragon. Some say they broke up in angst, some say they found wealth beyond imagination. What Mylar studies is unknown, he seems benign to some and to others he is whispered to do many foul things. His companion Sam is said to be a little goblin or a large blue monster (think Ogre Magi) or a multitude of other creatures. As with anything unknown the stories that are passed around are legion and just as varied. Some say the tower is the an entrance to a hidden warren of dwarves ruins filled with gold and other riches from the ground. Others say there is a hidden dungeon where an evil cult once flourished until Mylar deafened them with his powerful magics. in near by towns and villages, Mylar is seen as a tall, skeletal man who shows up to purchase supplies from time to time, He never uses his name and plays off that he is a herder of sheep in the mountains. Mylar loves to read and travels to larger cities to seek out and purchase tomes of all sorts. Thus there is also rumored to be a large library in his abode. Mylar is a very high level wizard that truly just wants to be alone. He is overly tall at seven and one half feet and so thin to look skeletal. He will try to dissuade anyone that shows up at his doorstep up to defending his home with deadly force. His companion is also fiercely loyal and will use all his abilities as an Ogre Magi to defend Mylar. The tower and abandoned mine under the tower are laced with magical and non magical traps in case someone does make it into the tower. Mylar will be relentless in his defense and if defeated will not rest until he has recovered his home and possessions . The tower is in good repair , while the vegetation surrounding it is over grown more to lack of interest than anything. Mylar prefers the fresh crisp air from his tower top to the shadows of the ground. I hope this all is coherent and please edit as you see fit.",

The other villagers used to just ignore him though it soon turned to jokes, the villagers one day they had finally had enough and demanded he be exiled. Gunthor, the town's blacksmith, had seen them though; their eyes staring through deep forests getting closer day by day, in the end he was happy to leave. He took what the cart could carry, loading his family and tools and headed out to find a new life. Others from the village were happy to join his caravan, they too had heard enough howling and screaming in the night, others were either too foolish or too cowardly to brave the surrounding woods, they couldn't wield a weapon as Gunthor did. Though the marshes weren't the most ideal location for a new settlement it was far enough from the village and the lands were rich with iron ore, Gunthor would be able to craft new weapons and erect some simple defenses. Days quickly became months and more permenant shelters were being built, others had stopped by to offer trade or sometimes join their colony. This was their new home, away from those prying eyes and safe enough to call it home, for now.",

Some say the gleaming white, honeycomb structure merely appeared one day, or is the last remains of some ancient God. But legends tell that any who manages to scale the unnaturally smooth tower will live out the rest of their days blessed with peace and prosperity. Few have succeeded. Most fall to their doom below, where their bodies are left to rot and feed the earth beneath the tower. To those who live in the Seven-Four-Seven, this is an honorable death. These bones remain undisturbed, bleached white like the tower over centuries. The Seven-Four-Seven can be a terrible sight to behold for newcomers, but the townsfolk are among the most welcoming and agreeable in the region. So long as visitors don't disturb the bones.",
