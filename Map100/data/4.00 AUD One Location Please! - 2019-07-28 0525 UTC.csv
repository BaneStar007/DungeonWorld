Lush forests, deep and thick, grow at its base. Trails cut through the forest disappear quickly, the woods quick to reclaim what's theirs once again, making it very easy for the average traveler to get lost. The fortress was built for the gold and jewels harvested from mountain stone, though the rock here is very tough and unforgiving. In addition to the rough stone and thick forest growth, the lower terrain also host numerous formidable creatures, from large spiders to ferocious greystone panthers and everything inbetween.","The fortress was constructed of harshly cut stone, dwarven inspired carvings, but constructed by men. Statues are usually imposing, like armored knights with shield and sword, or fearsome creatures. The front gate to the steps is guarded by twin knights with massive shields, intricately detailed and at the ready, as if they could spring to life and battle at any moment. The steps rise up beside the waterfall, with occasional outcroppings for statues or guardposts where the terrain allowed. The black magic conducted at the castle appears to have had an affect over all of it, turning even the stone darker.

Its wealth grew rapidly, fed with gold and jewels pulled from deep in the mountain. But greed corrupts, and the heart of Vonnarath grew darker with every jewel extracted from the stone. It is believe some of those very treasures harbored an evil in their faceted glimmers, and before long the master of Vonnarath himself delved into the dark magical arts. The reach of evil spread beyond the fortress walls, spreading to the forests like a plague, inviting the foulest of creatures to surface. Vonnarath fell to its own evils, the darkness consuming every soul until no man remained alive. Now it sits in deathly silence, its fires extinguished, its halls dark. But it is not abandoned. Something still dwells there, though what evil it is remains a mystery. It’s rumored that a massive treasure still sits deep within Vonnarath’s belly, guarded by a fearsome creature beyond all evils. Some say it’s a great black dragon, a serpent of fire and ash. Others tell of a massive spider, larger than a house, fangs glistening with hunger beneath eight eyes of pure blackness.
