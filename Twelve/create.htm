<h2>Creation of a new WIC form</h2>
<h3>Inner Workings</h3>
<p>WIC Forms rely on data being passed, on creation, from the parent window which opened it. </p>
<ul>
    <li> The JWT of the session, to have DB access</li>
    <li> The Client (our client) ID to access the forms</li>
    <li> The Form ID for which form we are loading</li>

</ul>
<p>If the Form loads with the Following data, we can save the user some time</p>
<ul>
    <li> The Consultants ID, Who is filling in the form, (this is typically included)</li>
    <li> The Employee ID, When coming from the Employees link, otherwise will need async, autocomplete</li>
    <li>Other? At this stage unknown</li>
    <li>Modules? the Angular7 project uses some modules for permissions, we'll need to see how this affects forms</li>

</ul>

<p>Once you are sure The above are being set by the Button, The siteVisitForm.html page will build itself in the browser</p>

<h3>The Form Config</h3>
<p>In the Forms Folder, save a config file with the name matching the FormID, This way the FormBuilder will load the correct
    config.json</p>
<p>open a json Builder, i.e.
    <a href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/">https://jsoneditoronline.org/</a> to ensure your json is clean </p>


<p>Follow the Instructions on how to build a new json, Ensure that you have the correct settings for INPUT fields vs TEXT fields.
