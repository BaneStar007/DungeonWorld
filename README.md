# DungeonWorld Site storage

This repo is for the Dungeonworld website, nothing special, just some code tests, projects, etc thats easier to store online as PCs come and go. Slowly migrating all the other code projects I've done over the years into here. 

What Am I doing? Playing around with web technologies, Making stuff for fun, thoughts on attempting to write entire websites with just CSS and content: '', without any HTML? or just AngularJS directives, with no native controllers or page declarations? How about eky-eky-eky-f-pang? ever heard of that? Express Node3, PHP Angular stack? Ex-x3 phpang? Mothy Python Joke? 

But Eky-Ph-PAng is a PHP back end which builds Angular components as needed, so the client only gets the bits they have permissions or access for, without needing to pass over all the Angular code to the client end, and all Ajax calls are sent to the Node, for higher secuirty (and so I can include the 'eky' abbr at the beginning, otherwise it'd just be Ph-Pang!

## Dungeonworld?

### My offical stance:

Dungeonworld was created, by me, in 1991, as a business & product name, in 92 when I understood patent laws, logos etc, I put together a small ammount of money and registered it, I was 17 at the time, so my father helped with the paperwork. I started a club, with the same name, and had over 500 paid entries that year, we played board games, roleplay games, painted miniatures, it was fun. In '94, I decided to write my own rules, properly, and got a copyright on my game rules & logo. 

Things Expire, this is true, but thanks to Disney corp. They expire long after your gone. So Officially, I still own Dungeonworld, the title, the label, the logo, just that another couple of enterprising gentlemen used the name on their product, in another country, and I'm not going to be rude and try and get them to stop, as long as they don't try to stop me using my name too.

### That said..

I don't want to confuse the market, Dungeonworld will remain the main product title, yet under that banner, the games will be published as "Dungeon Delvers Twelve" for the lite rules version, and "The Coyn" for the world lore, When they gain enough traction, and interest is shown for the heavier rules, I'll attempt to publish them under "Dungeonworld: Origins" for the core rules and world build lore, so gamesmasters can 'join' the legacy, Multi-gamesmastered Game.
